# benchinit

Benchmark the initialization cost of your packages or programs.

	go get mvdan.cc/benchinit

This includes the cost of `init` functions, plus initialising globals. In other
words, a package's contribution to the slowness before `main` is run.

Requires Go 1.12 or later.

### Quickstart

Benchmarking a single package is simple:

	benchinit cmd/go

You can also include all dependencies in the benchmark:

	benchinit -r cmd/go

Finally, like any other benchmark, you can pass in `go test` flags:

	benchinit -r -count=5 -benchtime=2s cmd/go
